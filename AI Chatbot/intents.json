Here are some examples: \n Reading \n Listening to music \n Singing \n Cleaning \n Walking \n Cooking or Baking"]

Purposefully set aside around 20-30 minutes of designated 'worry time' ideally at least 2 hours before bed time. During those 20-30 minutes, you can write down whatever's worrying you and then solutions to address those concerns. \n So that at night, whenever you're tempted to let your mind race, simple remind yourself that you've already addressed those concerns and need to let it go, or tell yourself that you'll worry about it during your set time tomorrow instead. \n 2. Make a to-do list for tomorrow \n This way, you wont stay up thinking of everything that needs to be done the following day. \n The to-do list should contain manageable items, like buying groceries, or completing homework. \n 3. Create a buffer zone that takes up about 30 minutes between the hustle and bustle of the day and the tranquility of sleep. \n You can use this time to unwind from the day and prepare your body for sleep. \n You can do anything that brings you calm and peace, such as taking a hot bath or shower, reading a book or listening to calming music. \n If possible, pick an offline, no screens activity as bright devices or lights in your home can keep you alert at bed time. \n Hopefully this helped you fall asleep better! Good night and sweet dreams! :)"]
